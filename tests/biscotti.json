        "description": "I grew up in the ’80s. We had a curved glass-brick wall in the living room, I had unironic Jordache jeans and an asymmetrical bob, and it was cool to order biscotti for dessert. That hairdo is a pretty hard sell today, but these firm but tender cookies deliver. Dunk them in rum, amaro, cold milk, or espresso and, if you’re like me, be thankful you went through your awkward phases in an era before digital photography.",

Using towel, vigorously rub hazelnuts to remove skins (it’s okay if not all of them release); roughly chop nuts and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F."

Remove from the oven; let cool 15 minutes (longer is okay, but it needs at least this much time to firm up a bit). Carefully transfer loaf to a cutting board, then use a serrated knife to cut it crosswise into ½-inch-thick pieces. Using both prepared baking sheets this time, lay slices on a cut side and bake until the surfaces feel dry and crisp, 35 minutes. Let biscotti cool completely before eating. Store airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week."
