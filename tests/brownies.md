This recipe calls for not just one but three types of chocolate, leaving you with homemade brownies that are fudgy and dotted with pools of melted chocolate.

Yields: Makes 12 in 0 minutes

## Ingredients
- Nonstick vegetable oil spray or unsalted butter, room temperature
- 62 g (½ cup) all-purpose flour
- 50 g (½ cup) Dutch-process cocoa powder (such as Guittard cocoa rouge)
- 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt
- ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 113 g (4 oz.) bittersweet chocolate, preferably 70%, broken into pieces
- 250 g (1¼ cups) granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract
- 113 g (4 oz.) semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°. Lightly coat a metal 8x8" baking pan with nonstick vegetable oil spray or unsalted butter, room temperature, then line with parchment paper, leaving generous overhang on 2 sides. Lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray.
2. Whisk 62 g (½ cup) all-purpose flour, 50 g (½ cup) Dutch-process cocoa powder, and 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a small bowl to combine.
3. Combine ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter and 113 g (4 oz.) bittersweet chocolate, preferably 70%, broken into pieces, in a medium metal bowl set over a large saucepan of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not be touching water). Heat, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and smooth, about 5 minutes.
4. Whisk in 250 g (1¼ cups) granulated sugar, then add 3 large eggs one at a time, whisking very vigorously between additions. Once all eggs are incorporated, continue to whisk 1 minute more. Remove bowl from heat and whisk in 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract, then whisk in dry ingredients. Using a rubber spatula, stir in 113 g (4 oz.) semisweet chocolate chips. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth surface.
5. Bake brownies until set across top and a tester inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 27–30 minutes. Let cool in pan at least 30 minutes, preferably in refrigerator, before cutting into 12 pieces.
Do ahead: Brownies can be baked 4 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
