Yields: 9 in 50 minutes

## Ingredients
- 8 oz bittersweet chocolate, chopped*
- 1/2 cup (115g) extra virgin olive oil**
- 1 1/2 tsp instant espresso powder
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar, divided
- 5 large eggs, separated
- Powdered sugar for dusting
- Ice cream (any flavor)
- Fresh berries
- Whipped cream
- Homemade salted caramel
- Chocolate ganache

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350F and coat a 9&#8243; springform pan in nonstick spray. Place a sheet of parchment paper to cover the bottom plate and insert the ring to lock it in place.
2. In a heat safe bowl, add the chopped chocolate and oil. Place over a pot of simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn&#8217;t touch the water. Stir until melted, then remove from the pot.
3. Mix in the espresso powder and vanilla, then allow the chocolate to cool while yo whip the egg whites.
4. Separate the eggs and add the whites to a large bowl, either using a hand or stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Whip the egg whites on high speed for about 5 minutes. When they start to lighten and thicken, slowly pour in 1/2 cup of sugar with the mixer still running. Continue to whip until you reach stiff peaks.
5. Now to the bowl of chocolate, mix in the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and then the egg yolks one at a time. The mixture will begin to thicken and turn very fudgy.
6. Use a rubber spatula and add two scoops of the whipped egg whites to the chocolate. Mix until it&#8217;s fully combined. This helps thin out the batter to make it easier to fold in the rest of the egg whites.
7. Dump in the rest of the egg whites and gently fold to combine. You might think the batter is too separated and won&#8217;t come together, but just keep folding! By the end you should be left with a brownie batter consistency.
8. Pour the batter into the pan and spread it even. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until it&#8217;s evenly puffed up.
9. Allow the cake to cool for about 10 minutes. The cake will being to flatten out as it cools to create a deliciously rich and fudgy texture.
10. Release the cake from the pan and top with a dusting of powdered sugar or ice cream&#8230;or both! It&#8217;s best served warm no need to wait for it to cool completely. Enjoy!
