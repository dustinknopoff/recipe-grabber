I grew up in the ’80s. We had a curved glass-brick wall in the living room, I had unironic Jordache jeans and an asymmetrical bob, and it was cool to order biscotti for dessert. That hairdo is a pretty hard sell today, but these firm but tender cookies deliver. Dunk them in rum, amaro, cold milk, or espresso and, if you’re like me, be thankful you went through your awkward phases in an era before digital photography.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup (67 g) hazelnuts
- 3  large eggs
- 2 tablespoons (16 g) instant coffee or espresso
- 2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup (20 g) unsweetened
- Dutch-process cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons (10 g) baking powder
- 1 teaspoon (3 g) kosher salt
- 8 tablespoons (4 ounces/ 112 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup (192 g) sugar, plus more for sprinkling
- 2 teaspoons (10 ml) pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (90 g) semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Place hazelnuts on a small rimmed baking sheet and toast until darkened and fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. Wrap in a clean kitchen towel to trap steam and let cool, 10 minutes. Using towel, vigorously rub hazelnuts to remove skins (it’s okay if not all of them release); roughly chop nuts and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F.
2. Separate 1 egg, placing white and yolk in separate small bowls. Cover egg white; set aside. Crack remaining 2 eggs into the bowl with egg yolk. Add the instant coffee to the whole egg mixture and beat to combine. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter and sugar on medium speed until creamy, 2 minutes. Scrape down the bowl, then add the egg mixture and vanilla and beat on medium until combined, 1 minute. Scrape again and beat until creamy. Add the flour mixture and mix on low until combined, 20 seconds; scrape the bowl. Add the nuts and chocolate chips; mix on low to combine.
4. Scrape dough out onto one prepared baking sheet. With damp hands, press dough into a loaf about 14 inches long, 4 inches across, and 1 inch thick. Beat egg white until foamy, then brush it over the top and sides of the dough. Sprinkle an even, generous layer of sugar over top.
5. Bake until the loaf is firm in the center when pressed and starting to crisp around the edges, 35 to 40 minutes, rotating pan halfway through (it will spread as it bakes). Remove from the oven; let cool 15 minutes (longer is okay, but it needs at least this much time to firm up a bit). Carefully transfer loaf to a cutting board, then use a serrated knife to cut it crosswise into ½-inch-thick pieces. Using both prepared baking sheets this time, lay slices on a cut side and bake until the surfaces feel dry and crisp, 35 minutes. Let biscotti cool completely before eating. Store airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week.
